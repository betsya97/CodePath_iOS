# Pre-work - *iOS Tip Calculator*

**Tip Calculator** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Betsy Avila**

Time spent: **2.5** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Settings tab was created which can switch between the calculating page and settings page.

## Notes

Challenges I faced where including more UI features to the app. Sliders were a first thought of to change the percentages of the tip, also a feature to split the bill would have been more useful. Something else I would have added is a loading screen to "introduce" the user to the app. A switch for dark mode was also an idea I had but the documention I found only included changing the phone settings to dark, which changed the appearance of the app. 
Working with Swift was a new experience in which I would like to learn more of. The syntax was easier to understand since I have a general background of OOP languages like C++. However, using the storyboard proved a bit of a challenge for me to grasp such as adding more controllers and connecting the logic.
